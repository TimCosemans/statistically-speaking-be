## Bio

I love uncovering the stories hidden in data. By combining analytical techniques with behavioral data, I aim to understand why people make the choices they do and how those patterns shape the world around us.

Whether it’s predicting student drop-out, optimizing marketing strategies, or exploring decision-making in organizations, I enjoy bridging the gap between numbers and real-life behavior. For me, data isn’t just about models and algorithms—it’s a way to gain deeper insights into human nature.

Beyond my technical work, I’m passionate about sharing knowledge, whether through teaching, mentoring, or collaborating with stakeholders to make AI and data science more accessible and ethical. At the end of the day, my goal is to use data not just for predictions, but to better understand and improve the way we interact, learn, and grow.
